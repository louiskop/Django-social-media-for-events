# Django-social-media-for-events
A demo python django web app (backend, frontend with bootstrap & db with sqlite). This project is incomplete and abandoned as it was only used for learning purposes

This is a social media style website where a user can create a account and host a party or event. They can then add details such as age,  location, drinks ect. 
There is also commenting functionality.


## What I Learned
- python django framework
- how database models work (sqlite)
- how a web backend works
- how to return frontend
- styling with bootstrap CSS
