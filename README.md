# Django-social-media-for-events
A website in development with python django framework. This was only a learning project but turned out to become more than that, so sorry for all the ugly code

# What is this?
This is a social media style website where a user can create a account and host a party or event. They can then add details such as age,  location, drinks ect. It is still in development and alot of features need to be added like private parties and guestlists.
You can search by location and find all nearby parties.

This will make finding and hosting a party or event much easier!

## Feel free to join in and help!
